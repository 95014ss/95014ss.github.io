<img src="joey.jpg">
<center><p><font size="6"> computer showed up.The computer started showing random links by itself  and putting up random pictures of him and his babysitter.</font></p></></center>
<img src="oloo.jpg">
<center><p><font size="6">And everyone knows that he has $500,000,000 googleplex  so if he gets hacked he will lose all that money  </font></p></></center>
And everyone knows that he has $500,000,000 googleplex  so if he gets hacked he will lose all that money 
So  Jamnjoey went to his master computer and checked his bank account info……………..It said he had zero dollars.

Chapter 2 : Jamnjoey faints
 


That stunned him. He was paralyzed for some time then he fainted.He was dreaming about how he would get his money when his babysitter put her smelly socks in Jamnjoey nose.
He suddenly woke up .

Chapter 3: Jamnjoey wakes up 

<center><p><font size="6"> His babysitter told him to tell the police .He went to his bubba mobile and drove his car their but while on the way Jamnjoey got chased by  </font></p></></center>

<img src="joog.jpg">
the police and got a speeding ticket for driving his car so fast.

<center><p><font size="6">Then the police made him tow his car.After that the police car left.So Jamnjoey had a option of walking or 
<img src="uop.jpg">  </font></p></></center>
So he did uber.The uber car dropped him to the police station. Jamnjoey rushed inside and  asked the police officer what to do. The police recommended him Bubba boy the world’s best security engineer and told that he lived in Bubba land.

So Jamnjoey  went to his private jet 
<img src="boo.jpg">
<center><p><font size="6">to make him go to  Bubba land and set off.When they landed at</font></p></></center>

 Bubba land he took a taxi and went to Bubba boy’s house.Bubba boy said that the hack was called Balbua of the Phapusa Papaya Papaya hack,and what it did was that it took all your photos and sent them to everyone in the whole wide galaxy.It also took all your passwords and money gave  it to the person who hacked it.



Chapter 4: WHHHAT!!!!!! 


    WWHHHHHHAAAAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Jamnjoey yelled. That was the biggest shock Jamnjoey ever had. 
  
    Jamnjoey fainted yet again.

<center><p><font size="6">Chapter 5:Jamnjoey goes home 


After 2 hours of Jamnjoey  woke up with the sound of the car  the Jaguar F-Type R 
</font></p></></center>
<img src="jagu.jpg">

<center><p><font size="6">Jamnjoey quickly got up.When he woke up he found that he was on his private jet and 

about to reach his house .</font></p></></center>He saw Bubba boy in his Jaguar F-Type R driving station (one of those was the car that woke him up).Then the jet landed.

<img src="man.jpg">

</font></p></></center>
<center><p><font size="6">.Chapter 6:Bubba boy helps Jamnjoey When</font></p></></center>

 



Jamnjoey reached his house,Bubba boy went to Jamnjoey’s master computer and Bubba boy typed 

a bunch of code and kept typing it for 5 hours
<img src="co.jpg">
<center><p><font size="6">And it was about to work when Jamnjoey asked for looking at</font></p></></center> it and deleted all the code Bubba boy wrote and since Jamnjoey’s Master computer was very old it did not have command z so Jamnjoey was terrified he was about to faint when his babysitter drove the Jaguar F-Type R so he immedietly woke up again when Bubba boy started a chant since he was a bubba native person.Won-a-nee-a won-a-nee-a when an idea popped in Bubba boys brain.He asked Jamnjoey when the computer was made and jamnjoey said 1945.So Bubba Boy remembered that instead of  command z you do command 1234567890 so Bubba boy did that and    Voila!!! Jamnjoey got all his money back!!




Chapter 7:Bubba boy goes home

Just after that Balbua called Jamnjoey and said that he got hacked so Jamnjoey yelled <center><p><font size="20">Got mud on your face big disgrace!</font></p></></center>
